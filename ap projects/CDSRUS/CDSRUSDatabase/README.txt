This folder contains the database for the CDSRUS problem.  It is 
strongly advised to use only a few CD's to get your solution debugged.
Once you are confident that it works properly, then run your program
with the real databases in this folder.

cdsrus - contains all of the raw data in one file (artists, prices, albums all mixed together)
albums - contains only the album names (Strings)
prices - contains all of the prices for each album (doubles)
artists - contains all of the artists in the database
