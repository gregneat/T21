Welcome to Void Within!

Void Within is a survival type game where your main goal is to survive as long as you can! 
Enemy ships are on the hunt and you must outrun them if you can! 
When you first play the game you will find yourself in a spacesation where you can navigate through the lobby and hanger. 
In the Hanger you can choose different ships which have different statistics varing from super fast to slow but tanky.
Once you have found your preference start up the game from the main lobby and try to survive as long as you can!
Make sure you do not fly out of bounds or through skybox, this would result in you being eliminated. Once eliminated the game will end.
GoodLuck and enjoy!!!
